## 2.2 Summary of the Project

	

## AI/ML Algorithms

	Since the bot will be attempting to beat the maps within a specified time limit, reinforcement learning using neural networking best fits this goal. 


## Evaluation Plan

	The main goal is for the AI to be able to reach a certain goal point(s) as quickly as possible while avoiding any obstacles or pits. As the AI goes through more trials and runs into obstacles, it should be able to learn from its mistakes and explore different paths to decide the fastest successful route to the end goal or midpoints. In time, it should be able to consistently choose the best path to be equal to or better than the average human player in reaching the goal.
	The AI will be analyzed/verified by checking the time of the route as well as whether it misses any midpoints in applicable courses as midpoints are increased in number. The “moonshot case” would be for the AI to be able to learn from completely new and complicated maps found online, such as on minecraftmaps.com and be able to find the fastest solution to these maps created by separate users.
